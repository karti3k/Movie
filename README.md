# Simple Movie Finder Site
This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for movies using a search bar. Upon entering a query, the application retrieves matching movies from The Movie Database (TMDb) API and displays them to the user.
Although this is just a frontend part, later on, we can try to build its backend part.

## What's special about this?
### A Good Project for Beginners
This project provides an excellent starting point for beginners to kickstart their journey into web development. It covers fundamental concepts and offers hands-on experience in building a basic web application using HTML, CSS & JS.

## What Core JS Concepts One Can Learn from This Project?
### 1. Fetch Function of Fetch API in JS
The project utilizes the `fetch` function of the Fetch API to retrieve movie data from the TMDb API. This asynchronous method simplifies making HTTP requests and handling responses.

### 2. Promises and Chaining in JS
Promises are leveraged in this project for managing asynchronous tasks, including fetching movie data and rendering it on the webpage. Users can observe how promises are chained together for efficient handling of sequential asynchronous operations.

### 3. Dynamic Content Creation in JS Using Append
The project showcases dynamic content creation using JavaScript's `appendChild` method. As users search for movies, the application dynamically generates HTML elements to display search results in real-time. This illustrates how the DOM can be manipulated to create responsive and interactive web interfaces.
